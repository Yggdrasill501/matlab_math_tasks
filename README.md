# Matlab math Tasks

## Intro
Firstly I wanted to use [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/). Why?! Well because of opportunities of collaboration, virtual machine and friendly UI, eventhought I was not able to run it as notebook, there is a space for futrure improvemnt,
Secondly I used [Octave](https://octave.org/) because I preref open source and community tools.
In the end I would love to give props to this [Article](https://community.deepnote.com/c/showcase/custom-environment-for-gnu-octave).
